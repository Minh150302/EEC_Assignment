# Power Bank Project

This repository contains the hardware and documentation for the Power Bank Project.

## Components Used

### 1. **Capacitors**
   - **Capacitor 103**: 10nF ceramic capacitor, commonly used for decoupling and filtering.

### 2. **Zener Diode**
   - **Zener Diode**: Used for voltage regulation, typically in reverse bias to maintain a constant voltage across it.

### 3. **Resistors**
   - A variety of resistors used for current limiting, voltage division, and pull-up/pull-down applications.

### 4. **Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp)**
   - **LM358**: A dual op-amp IC, commonly used for signal conditioning, amplification, and filtering.

### 5. **LEDs**
   - **Red LED**: A red light-emitting diode, used for status indication, such as charging or low battery.
